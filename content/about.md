# About Me

I'm a Cognitive Scientist turned Data Scientist, bridging the gap between human understanding and artificial intelligence. With four years in the field, I've dedicated my career to transforming complex business challenges into elegant AI solutions.

## What I Do

My expertise lies in:
- Developing and deploying AI solutions on Azure Databricks
- Creating advanced natural language processing systems
- Building innovative applications with generative AI
- Designing human-centered machine learning solutions

## My Approach

My background in cognitive science gives me a unique perspective on AI development. I believe in creating technology that doesn't just process data, but truly understands and adapts to human needs. Every solution I develop combines cutting-edge technology with intuitive design, ensuring that AI serves as a tool for human enhancement rather than replacement.

## Beyond the Code

When I'm not immersed in the world of data and AI, you'll find me:
- Catching waves on my surfboard
- Contributing to education initiatives in Puerto Rico
- Supporting rural development projects
- Exploring new ways to apply AI for social good

## Let's Connect

I'm always excited to collaborate on innovative projects or discuss the future of AI. Whether you're interested in technical partnerships, community initiatives, or just want to chat about the intersection of cognitive science and AI, feel free to reach out.
